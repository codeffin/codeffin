Hello World, I'm Griffin!

- CURRENTLY, I am working on a full-stack📚 web application that stores information about jobs I apply to!
      1. So I can keep track of the THOUSANDS of applications!
      2. I got tired of scrolling through a loooooong Excel spreadsheet🥱
  
- I am always trying to understand what is going on under the hood⚙⚙. I HATE BLACK BOXES! I feel great satisfaction when I know how something
  works, aaaalllll the way down to how it interacts with the bare metal💯💪. At the end of the day its all 1️⃣s and 0️⃣s baby!🙌

- Right now I am reading: C O D E by Charles Petzold!

- My number one priority atm is to get a job developing software, so if you want to work with me lmk!
